## 1. Introduction

Greenhouses play a crucial role in modern agriculture by providing controlled environments that optimize plant growth. However, conventional greenhouse heating systems often rely on **fixed heater placement**, leading to **uneven temperature distributions** and **inefficient energy consumption**. To address these issues, this project introduces an **adaptive heating control system** using **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** to dynamically adjust heater positions and heating power in response to changing microclimate conditions.

Our approach integrates:
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Algorithm** for learning optimal heating strategies.
- **Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)** for predicting future temperature distributions.
- **EnergyPlus + GreenLightPlus Simulation** for accurately modeling greenhouse microclimates and energy consumption.

The results demonstrate that **adaptive control can reduce temperature deviation by up to 25.51% and energy consumption by up to 34.74% compared to fixed heater deployments**, making it a promising solution for energy-efficient smart greenhouses.

   - Simulates the greenhouse environment using **EnergyPlus** and **GreenLightPlus**.
   - Computes indoor temperature distributions and energy consumption.
   
2. **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Model**:
   - Uses **PPO** to control heater movement and power levels.
   - **GRUs** predict future temperature distributions based on weather data.
   
3. **Control Execution**:
